												<h5 align="center">Figure 1 Brain structural (left) and functional plasticity (right) in different PA levels</h5><br>
												<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> Prepuberty and puberty are critical periods with brain develop rapidly until become a highly structured and functionally specialized brain. And the plasticity of gray and white matter continues into the 30<sup>th</sup> year of life<sup>[1]</sup>. <br> Previous studies found that PA can significantly promote the development of brain function which is related to the improvement of cognition function and academic performance<sup>[2-4]</sup>.<br>
												Physical activity (PA) refers to any bodily movement resulting from energy expenditure of skeletal muscles<sup>[5]</sup>. Its intensity can be quantified by the frequency, times, and the feelings of daily physical exercise<sup>[6]</sup>. 
											</p>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/RF1-2.png" alt="" />
												<h5>Figure 2 Surface area of regions that significant correlated with PA</h5>
											</a>
											<div class="inner">
												<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> PA shows a positive relationship to the surface area of left postcentral gyrus (Figure 2: left) and shows an invers-U relationship to right inferior temporal gyrus (Figure 2: right).<br>
													Previous research found that the postcentral gyrus is the location of the primary somatosensory cortex and it is responsible for processing information related to the sense of touching<sup>[7]</sup>. The number of synaptic neurons of the primary somatosensory cortex may be increased under the action of somatic and external sensory stimulation during physical activities.<br>
												Inferior temporal gyrus is one of the higher levels of the ventral stream of visual processing, associated with the representation of objects, places, faces, and colors<sup>[8]</sup> and its relationship with PA should be further studied.</p>

											<h4>2 <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.687974/full">The Influence of Key Facial Features on Recognition of Emotion in Cartoon Faces</a></h4>
											<p>As an attractive art form, cartoon faces are widely used in daily life. Cartoon animation is an important carrier that not only helps children to acquire emotional knowledge<sup>[1, 2]</sup> but enables adults to express feelings and attitudes<sup>[3]</sup>. <br>
											Sophisticated computing models have been developed to animate emotional facial expressions with different types of artistic cartoon avatars in 2D and 3D<sup>[4-6]</sup>, but some critical issues remain unclear, such as how people recognize the emotional facial expressions in cartoon faces and the underlying perception mechanisms.<br>
											Although previous studies have used abstract nonreal faces with facial configurations similar to those of real faces<sup>[7-10]</sup>, some critical questions remain, such as whether cartoon facial expressions convey a higher degree of emotional intensity than real ones and what the mechanism for perceiving cartoon facial expression is.

														<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
														Therefore, in this study, three experiments were conducted to explore recognition of emotional facial expression on cartoon faces and the contribution of the single features. Experiment 1 aimed to explore whether the accuracy and intensity perception of emotional expressions differ for cartoon faces and real human faces when whole faces are presented. Experiments 2 and 3 were conducted to examine the sufficiency and necessity of single facial features for emotional expression recognition.

														<h4>Experiment 1: Recognition of emotional information on cartoon and real faces</h4>
														<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The results revealed a happy expression advantage in cartoon faces, as happiness was identified more accurately than neutral and sad expressions.<br>
														we also found that sad expressions on cartoon faces tended to be perceived as sadder than sad expressions in real faces.<br><br>

														<h5>Figure 2 Influences of key facial features on recognition of emotion in cartoon faces</h5>
													</a>
													<div class="inner">
														<h4>Experiment 2 & 3: Sufficiency and necessity of specific facial features</h4>
														<p>Taken together with the results from Experiments 2 and 3, this shows that information from the mouth itself was sufficient for the participants to identify happy expressions, and the removal of the mouth significantly decreased the accuracy of happiness identification in cartoon faces.
														</p>
													</div>
													<p>The eyebrows had an important role in perceived emotional intensity of sad expressions. When only the eyebrows were presented, perceived intensity of sadness was not different from that when the full face was presented, but perceived intensity was significantly affected when the eyebrows were hidden.<br>
													The current study provides an important reference for extending existing facial emotion recognition studies from real faces to cartoon faces, and the importance of features that was revealed in this study may shed light on the development of cartoon characters for emotional and social artificial intelligence.</p>
